## Repository structure

This repository is organized in the following way:

1. The folder **baseline_model** contains the baseline model uploaded to the Grand Challenge website and some files, such as Dockerfile, that can be useful for uploading your own dockers.

2. The folder **evaluation_metrics** contains the metrics used for the evaluation of the challenge, so they can be used to test you results before being updated.
